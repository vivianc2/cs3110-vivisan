  Our project is an interactive mathematical prover. It allows users to perform basic mathematical proofs with fundamental inputs, e.g. rw, refl and so on. Then the prover will automatically implements the coresponding behaviors, including substituting variables, comparing eqaulity of two expressions and so on. Our future work is to extend the project to achieve weak induction and build a more user-friendly interface.
