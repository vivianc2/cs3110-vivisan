Our project is completed by a three person team. 

Our test files have meet the standard for over 50 test cases, which in total
composites about 50% of the total project LOC. This is within the set limit for 
length of test cases.

Meanwhile, since our project includes both data fiels and main program in OCaml, 
we have factor out data files into separate json files.
