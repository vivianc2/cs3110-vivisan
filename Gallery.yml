  Our project is an interactive mathematical prover. It allows users to perform basic mathematical proofs with fundamental inputs, e.g. rw, refl and so on. Then the prover will automatically implement the corresponding behaviors, including substituting variables, comparing equality of two expressions, weak inductions, adding zero to the current expression (e.g. evaluating a+0=a), succeeding the variable, and evaluating the succeeded as a + succ b = succ (a+b) or succ a = a + 1. 

  Also, we have built a more user-friendly interface including colorful coding in 'make play' to highlight different texts, explanatory error messages when the user attempts invalid techniques, and suggestions about proven statements. More specifically, we provide 'help', 'quit', 'retry', and multiple commands in 'make play'.
